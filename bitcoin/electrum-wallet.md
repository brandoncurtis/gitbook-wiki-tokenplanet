# Electrum Wallet

I recently built this version of Electrum locally to manage Bitcoin Testnet funds in a Ledger wallet.

Electrum also ships a server, ElectrumX, that plugs into your blockchain node of choice so you don't have to trust anyone else:

## Ledger Hardware Wallet

Unlike the Ledger desktop app, Electrum supports p2wkh wallets in addition to the legacy np2wkh and p2pkh wallets.

To interface with the Ledger, you'll also need to install btchip-python:
